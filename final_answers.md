# Final Answers

## Question 1:

Differences:

```bash
  - I had my universe piece inside my nbody class
  - I had a solid number, 640, inside my simulation size class
```
Similarities:

```bash
  - We had similar structure in the way we made our methods.
```

## Question 2:

Planet similarities:

```bash
  -We both used a constant for G
  -Both had a reset force method
  -Both had a total force, xforce, and a yforce
  -Both had a calculate acceleration method
```

Planet differences:

```bash
  -Did not have whatever that private thing was
  -Did velocity and position updates inside of the acceleration method
  -Did not draw with rotation
```

## Question 3:

Universe class advantages:

```bash
  -More organized
  -Easy to understand
```

Universe class disadvantages:

```bash
  -Not all in one place
  -Have to worry about a whole new class
```

## Question 4:

Other interesting differences:

```bash
  -The only major difference I see is the fact that I did the universe inside the nbody class

  I honestly prefer my code because it is what makes sense to me. I typically do things a little different usually, so it just makes sense.
```

## Question 5:

Coding strengths:

```bash
  -I am very creative in my code
  -I get my coding done quickly
  -I understand the processes of coding
```

Coding weaknesses:

```bash
  -Very unorganized
  -Almost impossible to understand for anyone just reading it
  -Still inexperienced as a coder
```
